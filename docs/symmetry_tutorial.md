In crystallography, **space groups** and **point groups** play essential roles in describing the symmetry of crystals. Let's break down what each of these terms means:

1. **Space Groups**:
   - A **space group** represents the **symmetry group** of a repeating pattern in **three-dimensional space**.
   - These ource: groups describe how the crystal lattice repeats itself, including both the arrangement of atoms and the overall shape of the crystal.
   - The elements of a space group (its **symmetry operations**) are rigid transformations (such as rotations, reflections, and translations) that leave the crystal pattern unchanged.
   - In three dimensions, there are **219 distinct space groups**, or **230 types** if we consider chiral copies as distinct.
   - Space groups are discrete cocompact groups of isometries in an oriented Euclidean space.
   - They are also known as **crystallographic groups** or **Fedorov groups**.
   - A definitive source for 3D space groups is the **International Tables for Crystallography**¹.

2. **Point Groups**:
   - Point groups describe the **symmetries of a single point** within a crystal lattice.
   - They focus on the local symmetry around a specific atom or point in the crystal.
   - Point groups consist of rotational and reflectional symmetry elements.
   - These elements include rotations (such as Cn axes), mirror planes (σ), inversion centers (i), and improper rotations (Sn).
   - The point group of a space group represents the **symmetry of the macroscopic crystal**.
   - Both kinds of symmetry (space groups and point groups) are characterized by symbols, and there are different systems of notation for labeling symmetry groups²³.

In summary, space groups describe the overall symmetry of the crystal lattice, while point groups focus on the local symmetry around individual points within the crystal. Together, they provide a comprehensive understanding of crystal symmetry.
